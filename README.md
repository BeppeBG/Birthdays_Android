## Getting started

+ Just open the files for your language (specified by country code) and edit what you think you can improve. Thank you!
+ You only have to change the phrases between &gt; and &lt; in each line. Example: &lt;string name="..."&gt;CHANGE THIS&lt;/string&gt;
+ Don't worry, you cannot make any mistakes. If something is not so good, we will correct that.
